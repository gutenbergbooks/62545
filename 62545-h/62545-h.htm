<p class="ph3">SECOND ARTICLE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> months ago, in an article entitled ‘The
Gaelic Nuisance,’ we endeavoured to point out
the impolicy of fostering Gaelic as the vernacular
tongue in the Highlands and Islands. Our observations
were variously received. Many approved
of the article; by some it was apparently misunderstood.
On this latter account, we return to
the subject, in the hope of removing such misapprehensions
as may happen to exist. This time,
at anyrate, we shall take care to be perfectly
explicit as to our meaning.</p>

<p>In the article referred to, we offered no objection
to the use of Gaelic, provided the young
were brought up with a knowledge of English.
That was distinctly our contention, and we
believe that such is the opinion of all who think
seriously on this important question. We therefore
repeat in terms on which nothing but perversity
can put a wrong construction, that the
fostering of Gaelic to the exclusion of English—for
it practically comes to that—is a grave error;
it is a cruelty which merits exposure and reprobation.
Why it is a cruelty is very clear. As previously
stated, the use of Gaelic as the only known
vernacular, keeps large numbers of poor people
ignorant, it usually fixes them to their place of
birth, and accordingly excludes them from earning
their bread in the general competition of the
world. It is very easy for enthusiasts living at
a respectful distance to write in glowing terms
about the antiquity of Gaelic, about the wonderful
beauty of Gaelic poetry, about the philological
value of Gaelic phraseology, about the satisfaction
of being able to speak Gaelic as well as English.
These are not the points in dispute. Let people,
if they will, and if they can afford the expense,
learn to speak and read Gaelic supplementary
to English, just as many of us learn to speak and
read French or German. The more languages
that can be acquired the better. About that
there is no contention. What we deem to be a
scandal and a cruelty is the practice of rearing, or
allowing to grow up, groups of children with a
knowledge of no other language than Gaelic; the
consequence being that they are for the most part
condemned to life-long poverty and ignorance.
And that is what is done through the mistaken
policy of it may be well-meaning sentimentalists
and philanthropists, who are seemingly unaware
of the misery they are helping to perpetuate. The
English language, like the laws and constitution of
the country, is a common heritage, in which every
child has a claim to be instructed, so that all may
be qualified to perform such duties as fall to their
lot. Is it not, then, shocking to find groups of
old and young scattered about the Highlands and
Islands who cannot speak a word of English, and
who cannot so much as sign their names? We
might almost say they have no more knowledge of
newspapers, or of English literature generally,
than the lower animals, amidst which in dreary
solitudes they hopelessly pass their existence.</p>

<p>The Highlanders have scarcely had justice done
to them. They possess characteristics of a noble
race. Faithful, honest, and steady in civil life.
Valorous as soldiers. Peaceful and law-abiding in
a very extraordinary degree. Those among them
who by some good fortune quit their native glens
and mix with the Lowland population, speedily
learn English, and are able to converse as fluently
in that language as in their native Gaelic. In fact,
wherever they are brought in contact with English-speaking
neighbours, they manifest no mental
deficiency. In many instances they have attained
to eminence. Only where they are habitually
neglected, and left in untoward circumstances to
vegetate in primitive ignorance, do they shew
anything like laziness, and an indifference to
improvement. From all we happen to know of
the Highlanders, they only need to be put in the
way of being cultivated by education and contact
with the outer world.</p>

<p>In hinting at educational deficiencies we tread
on tender ground. There is an Educational Act
applicable to the whole of Scotland, whether the
mainland or islands. No spot is exempted from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>{130}</span>
the operation of a school-board. Although the
Act was passed in 1872, it appears from one
cause or other that there are districts where no
schooling is available, and children are suffered to
run about wild. In an article in the <i>Scotsman</i>
newspaper of January 5, 1878, a correspondent
writing on the wretched condition of the Highland
‘crofters,’ or occupants of small patches of land,
refers to the educational deficiencies in the parish
of Barvas, on the west coast of Lewis. Here is
what he says: ‘At present, the children know not
a syllable of English; the women and thirty per
cent. of the men are as ignorant; and twenty per
cent. of the people married cannot sign their
marriage papers. One thing certain is that the
people are themselves totally unprepared for the
good that the Act is expected to do them; and
that it will be only by means of vigilant compulsory
officers that its full operation will be
secured. In the meantime the schools in the parish
have not been opened; and ragged boys and girls
hang about on the moor all day long herding
cattle, or idle near the wayside in companies of
threes and fours, holding fast by tethers, at the ends
of which small melancholy lambs are grazing.’
What a picture of primitive rural life! Education
practically non-existent. The compulsory provisions
of the School Act in a state of abeyance!</p>

<p>The island of St Kilda, to which we called attention,
exhibits a small population with no means
of learning English, and who for religious instruction
in Gaelic are wholly dependent on the Rev.
John M’Kay, a minister appointed by the Free
Church. This worthy individual, who is a bachelor
of advanced age, and whom, by mistake, we spoke
of as being married, can speak and read English;
but with the exception of the imported wife of
one of the natives, he is the only individual on
the island who can do so, and acts as a general
interpreter on the occasion of visits from strangers.
There is no school in the island, nor is there any
attempt to teach English. Is this a condition of
things which commends itself to philanthropists?</p>

<p>In a handsomely printed and illustrated work,
<i>St Kilda Past and Present</i>, by George Seton,
Advocate (Blackwood and Sons), 1878, there is
an effective reference to the want of education
in the island of St Kilda. ‘Probably,’ says this
observant writer, ‘the most beneficial influence
that could be brought to bear upon the St Kildans
would be of an educational kind. Through the
instrumentality of the Harris school-board or otherwise,
an energetic effort ought to be made to
introduce a systematic course of instruction in
English, with the view of the inhabitants enjoying
the vast benefits which would inevitably ensue.
At present, they are not only cut off from
regular communication with the mainland, but
in consequence of their ignorance of the language
of the United Kingdom, they are debarred from
the means of enlarging their minds, and subverting
their prejudices, by the perusal of English
literature. A recent number of <i>Chambers’s Journal</i>—to
which every English-speaking section of the
globe owes such deep obligations—contains an
admirable article, from the pen of the veteran
senior editor, on the subject of “The Gaelic
Nuisance,” to which I venture to call the attention
of all who are interested in the future welfare
of the inhabitants of St Kilda. The writer points
to Galloway on the one hand, and to the Orkney
and Shetland Islands on the other, as illustrative
examples of the blessings which have flowed from
the substitution of English for Gaelic and Norse
respectively; and in the course of his remarks
he makes special allusion to St Kilda.’</p>

<p>Thanking Mr Seton for this acknowledgment
of the correctness of our views, we pass on to
a note lately received from a sheriff-substitute in
a Highland county. He says: ‘Allow me to thank
you for your article in the last part of <i>Chambers’s</i>
entitled “The Gaelic Nuisance.” I have resided
here for several years, and am convinced that the
civilisation of the Highlands is impossible so long
as Gaelic continues to be the language of the
common people. I hope your article will open
the eyes of common-sense people to the necessity
of abolishing Gaelic as a spoken language, by the
substitution of English.’</p>

<p>A gentleman connected by heritage with one of
the outer Hebrides, sends us a note, in which,
after commenting on the grotesque objections that
had been made to our article, he observes: ‘We all
understand now—though a few may deceive themselves
and others—that man is not made for
language, but language for man. We Highlanders
are determined to adopt the current language, just
as we have adopted the current coin of the realm.’
This is plain speaking; and we hope that the
writer, using the power which his position gives
him, will in his own locality see that the children
are taught to read and understand English; such,
in our opinion, whatever others may think, being
only a simple act of justice.</p>

<p>In our former article we alluded to the case
of Wales, in which large numbers are as unhappily
excluded from a knowledge of the English
language as are many of the Gaelic-speaking
population of the Highlands. We are glad to see
that this deficiency is beginning to attract attention,
for reasons similar to those we employ.
Recently at a large meeting in connection with
the Welsh Church in Chester, presided over by
the Bishop of Chester, as reported in <i>The Times</i>,
Jan. 10, the Dean of Bangor, in speaking of Wales,
remarked: ‘Wales was in a certain extent backward.
In the power of influencing those outside
their own country, they were behind England,
Scotland, and Ireland, simply because their language
excluded them from making their thoughts
and views known to those of different nationality.... He
ventured to hope that the day
was rapidly approaching when every Welshman
would be able to use the English language.’
Such a public acknowledgment as this is eminently
satisfactory. It shews moral courage in combating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>{131}</span>
popular prejudice. We should like to see Highland
proprietors quite as openly avowing that it
was time every Gaelic-speaking child ‘was able
to use the English language.’</p>

<p>The most conclusive evidence that could be
advanced respecting the serious disadvantage of
maintaining Gaelic as an exclusively common
language is that offered by Mr Simon S. Laurie,
the accomplished Professor of Education in the
University of Edinburgh, who lately delivered an
Address on the subject of Education in the
Highlands. According to a newspaper report of
his address, he said in reference to the Highlanders:
‘One thing needful was to secure for
them freedom of locomotion; so that when the
pressure on one district became too great, the
people might move to another. Without a knowledge
of the English language, the country of
the Highlander was bound round him as with
a brazen wall. He need not try to get out of
it, because his native language put him at such
a disadvantage with other men that he had no
chance against them.... There was no doubt
that the teaching of Gaelic should be subordinate
to the teaching of English. If they trained a boy
in a Highland school to read, write, and speak
Gaelic, what were they to do with him? How
would we like to be in that position ourselves?
Fancy a boy at the age of fifteen or sixteen able
only to point out in Gaelic to a stranger the
way he should take; would they not find that
he had been miseducated—in fact cut off from
being a member of the British Empire altogether?
At the same time, while he held that,
he was of opinion that they could not teach
English to the Highlanders well except through
the Gaelic. The Highland children learned very
quickly—more quickly than the Lowland children—they
could soon read with perfect fluency such
a book as M’Culloch’s <i>Course of Reading</i>, and yet
not understand a single word; shewing that they
would not learn English well except through
Gaelic. The aim of the whole teaching should
be to make the pupils thoroughly acquainted with
English.’</p>

<p>With such a concurrence of evidence, and
with the knowledge that there is a School Act
of six years’ standing, why, it will be asked, are
children in the Highlands and Islands still left
to remain untaught in the elements of education?
That is a question that could perhaps best be
answered by the Education Board for Scotland.
We can only conjecture that the educational deficiency
in various quarters is due to the difficulty,
for pecuniary reasons, in establishing and maintaining
schools on a proper footing consistently
with the obligations of the statute. Mr Laurie
mentions that the school-rates press with a severity
which in some places is perfectly paralysing.
‘In Shetland, for example, the School Boards
were brought to a stand-still. They could not
face a rate of four shillings a pound; the same
proprietors having to pay not less than four
shillings a pound for poor-rate and other burdens
besides.’ This agrees with what we have privately
heard of Shetland, where the rates of one kind
or other very nearly swallow up the whole rental
drawn by proprietors. Mr Laurie states emphatically
as to this difficulty of school-rates, that
‘unless the government paid what was necessary
above fifteen-pence per pound, the Highlands
and Islands would not have the full benefit of
the Act of 1872.’</p>

<p>Evidently, the School Boards, notwithstanding
their comprehensive and compulsory powers, are
unable to plant and sustain schools in all quarters
where required. The difficulty, it is observed, is
financial. Let us instance the island of St Kilda.
Its inhabitants are said to be seventy-six in
number, while the annual rent exigible by the
proprietor is somewhere about a hundred pounds,
payable in kind. How can the School Board of
Harris, with which the island is connected parochially,
be expected to build a school and sustain
a schoolmaster for the benefit of so small a population,
in which there are perhaps only a very
few children of school age? To build a school
of the ordinary authorised type would cost at
least six hundred pounds. And the payment
of a teacher with other expenses would amount
to one hundred pounds a year. The organisation
of a school on this footing would go far beyond
what is desirable or what could be asked for from
either the state or the ratepayers.</p>

<p>A consideration of the financial difficulty leads
to the conviction that something very much less
costly than the present school organisation must
in many parts of the Highlands be attempted, if
the children are to get any education at all. Mr
Laurie very properly remarks that children ‘would
not well learn English except through the Gaelic;’
meaning by this, we suppose, that the teacher
would require through the agency of Gaelic to
explain the meaning of English words. That
surely would not be difficult to accomplish; nor
would it be unreasonable to establish schools on a
much more modest footing than those latterly
sanctioned by School Boards. The Scotch were
long accustomed to see a very humble class of
schools in secluded rural districts. Often, these
schools consisted of cottages of not more than two
apartments, one of which constituted the dwelling
of the teacher. These cottage schools were conducted
at an exceedingly small expense, yet they
answered their purpose. Neither dignified nor
imposing, they were useful. They imparted to the
few children in their respective neighbourhoods a
knowledge of letters. We are inclined to think
that a modification of this kind would solve some
existing difficulties as concerns the establishing of
schools among the sparse population of the Highlands
and Islands. In short, it would be well to
legalise a minor or sub-class of schools, to be
conducted at a small cost, designed to effect a
particular purpose, namely, that of communicating
a knowledge of the English language to large
numbers of poor children who are at present
growing up in ignorance of any spoken tongue
but their native Gaelic, and who, in many cases,
as is seen, have no education whatever.</p>

<p>We hope the nature of our pleading is no longer
misunderstood. It is, that all Gaelic-speaking
children may in some shape or other be taught to
read and understand the language common to the
United Kingdom. There may be some statutory
obstacles in the way. There should be none in
the light of humanity and common-sense. Perhaps
we may return to the subject. Considering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>{132}</span>
that the welfare of successive generations of
helpless beings is concerned, the subject is too
momentous to be lightly treated, or to be swept
aside by casual gusts of delirious opposition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.—FATHER AND SON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Sykes</span> was a weak man, and there are few
readier elements of mischief than that of a weak
man in a strong place—meaning thereby a position
where there is authority to be abused. Some of
the world’s worst tyrants have been emphatically
weak, mere spiteful capricious children grown to
man’s estate, and indued respectively with all the
powers of the purple, the royal jika, and the triple
tiara. But then the mighty system which they,
unworthy, swayed, resembled some gigantic engine
put into motion by the idle touch of a truant
urchin’s hand, and crushing all resistance by the
resistless force of its swaying levers and grinding
wheels.</p>

<p>A Devonshire baronet, in common with baronets
elsewhere, does expect to be to a certain extent the
petty autocrat of his own fields and hamlets, to
find that there are those who court the great
man’s smile and tremble at his frown, and to hold
rule within strictly constitutional limits over the
dwellers on his land and the inmates of his house.
The melancholy which had become a part of Sir
Sykes Denzil’s inner nature, and the indolence
which had gradually incrusted him, had prevented
the lord of Carbery from asserting in practice the
prerogatives which he knew to belong to him in
theory. Thus he did not really administer patriarchal
justice on his estate, as some hale landlords
do. His bailiff decided which labourers should
be employed, which dismissed, and what wages
should be allotted to crow-boys and weeding-girls.
The steward arranged as to the barns to be rebuilt,
the repairs to be granted or refused, the rent of
whose cottage was to be forgiven, or which arrears
were to be sternly exacted. Poachers whom the
head-keeper did not like, found Sir Sykes’s vicarious
wrath make the parish too hot to hold them,
while luckier depredators wired hares unpunished.</p>

<p>The part of a <i>roi fainéant</i> suited better with
Sir Sykes Denzil’s languid habits than they did
with his tolerably active mind. He was well
aware that the lethargy of King Log is always
supplemented by the not wholly disinterested
activity of King Log’s zealous ministers, and had
formed frequent resolutions as to taking into his
own hands the reins of government and becoming
in fact as well as in name the lord of the manor—of
six manors indeed, of which Carbery was the
chief. These resolutions had never been acted
upon; but Sir Sykes had always been able to lay
to his soul the flattering unction that it rested
with him alone to choose the time for realising
them.</p>

<p>The events of the last few weeks had given
some rude shocks to the baronet’s indolent self-complacency.
He had been threatened with
consequences of which he, and he alone, could
thoroughly comprehend the direful nature, and he
had been forced to a series of compliances, each of
which had degraded him in his own eyes. He
had borne with the cynic effrontery of the sailor
Hold. He had beneath his roof, seated at his
table, in constant association with him and his, an
unbidden guest. Mr Wilkins he had, through an
unlucky chance, encountered, and instantly the
fetters of a new vassalage appeared to be fastened
on his reluctant limbs. And he owed this fresh
humiliation to the misconduct of his own son!</p>

<p>Sir Sykes was very angry as he quitted No. 11
to seek out the chamber in which Jasper lay,
so angry that his temper overmastered for the
moment both the pleadings of natural affection and
the instinct of caution. He laid his hand brusquely
on the door of the room which had been pointed
out to him as that to which Jasper had been
conveyed, and was about to enter, with small
regard to the nerves of the invalid within, when he
felt a grasp upon his sleeve, and turned to be confronted
by the wiry figure, anxious face, and bead-like
black eyes of little Dr Aulfus.</p>

<p>‘Excuse me. Sir Sykes Denzil, unless I am very
much mistaken?’ said the doctor, taking off his
hat with such an air, that Sir Sykes, irritable as
he was, felt compelled to acknowledge the bow.
‘Allow me to introduce myself: Dr Aulfus,
Benjamin Aulfus, Ph.D., M.D., M.R.C.S. of
Heidelberg, Edinburgh, and London respectively.
We never chanced, before to-day, Sir Sykes, to
come personally into contact, and I regret that the
occasion of our first interview should be so sad a
one.’</p>

<p>During this speech, the doctor’s eyes had taken
stock as it were of Sir Sykes’s aspect, and had read
the signs of anger in his knitted brows and quivering
mouth as accurately as a mountain shepherd
discerns the portents of the coming storm. Nor
was the reason far to seek. Gossip had been busy,
of course, with the private affairs of so exalted a
family as that which dwelt at Carbery Chase; and
Sir Sykes would have been astonished to hear at
how many minor tea-tables the surgeon—for, his
medical diplomas notwithstanding, Dr Aulfus was
consulted nineteen times out of twenty as a general
practitioner—had listened while Captain Denzil’s
debts and his father’s displeasure were freely
canvassed.</p>

<p>Of the arrival of Mr Wilkins and of the
acceptances which the lawyer held, the little man
of healing could of course know nothing. But he
shrewdly surmised that Jasper had staked all that
he could scrape together, and probably more, on
the event of the desperate race which he had
ridden on that day, and that his pecuniary losses
had provoked the indignation of Sir Sykes, already
smarting under recent sacrifices.</p>

<p>‘You are very good, sir; I shall see my son,
and then’——</p>

<p>Sir Sykes had got thus far in his speech,
attempting the while to brush past the doctor,
when he found himself gently but resolutely
repulsed.</p>

<p>‘Now, Sir Sykes,’ said the little man, interposing
his diminutive person between the tall
baronet and the door, as some faithful dog might
have done, ‘pray have patience with me. Captain
Denzil is my patient. He has sustained severe
injury, the precise extent of which it is impossible
yet for science to determine, and I am responsible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>{133}</span>
for his safety, humanly speaking—the pilot, in
fact, with whom it rests to bring him into port.
We have just succeeded, by the help of an opiate,
in inducing sleep. It will not last long, on account
of the smallness of the dose. But it is of the
utmost consequence that it should not be broken;
and in fact, Sir Sykes, my patient is my patient,
and I must protect him even against his own
father.’</p>

<p>These last words were uttered in consequence
of a renewed attempt on the baronet’s part to
force a passage, and the persuasive tone in which
they were spoken contrasted oddly with the firmness
of the doctor’s attitude.</p>

<p>‘Really, Mr Aulfus,’ said Sir Sykes, half apologetically,
half in dudgeon; but the other cut him
short with: ‘Excuse me, Sir Sykes. <i>Dr</i> Aulfus,
if you please. It is perhaps the weakness of a
professional purist, but I do like to be dubbed a
doctor; as your noble neighbour and connection,
the Earl, no doubt has a preference for the title
of “My Lord.” It has cost me dear enough, sir,
that handle to my name; kept me, I may safely
say, out of a good four hundred a year of practice
I might have had, since old women and heads of
families are shy of sending for a regular physician;
and that’s why such fellows as Lancetter at High
Tor, and Druggett the apothecary in Pebworth
High Street, rattle about the county, feeling
pulses and sending out physic, when a man who
has more learning in his little finger than—— You
smile, sir; and indeed I was unduly warm. No
selfish love of lucre, believe me, prompted my
remarks, but a sincere scorn for the prejudices
and gullibility, if the word be not too strong, of
our Devonshire Bœotians.’</p>

<p>By this time the doctor had succeeded in getting
Sir Sykes into a neighbouring room, the door of
which stood invitingly open, and thus securing
the sleeper against the chance of being rudely
awakened from his slumber. The baronet too had
employed a minute or two in reflections which
shewed him how unseemly was the part which
he had been about to play, while some dim
consciousness that it was unfair to visit on Jasper
the unwelcome recognition and jocular impertinence
of Mr Wilkins, began to creep into his
perturbed mind.</p>

<p>‘You forget, Dr Aulfus,’ he said mildly enough,
‘that I have as yet heard no details as to the
injuries which my son has sustained. They are
not, I apprehend, of a very serious or indeed
dangerous character?’</p>

<p>‘Umph! Dislocation of right shoulder, now
reduced, but attended with much pain; severe
contusion on temple; some bad bruises, and complete
prostration of nervous system from the
stunning blow and violent concussion of spinal
cord,’ dryly rejoined the doctor, summing up the
facts as though he had been a judge putting the
pith of some case before a jury. ‘These are all
the results that I know of’—— And he paused,
hesitating, so that Sir Sykes for the first time
felt a genuine twinge of alarm.</p>

<p>‘Have you any suspicion, doctor, that there
is something worse than this?’ he asked, drawing
his breath more quickly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I hope not,’ returned Dr
Aulfus thoughtfully. ‘Our knowledge after all
is but cramped and bounded. I remember once
at sea (I was assistant-surgeon in the navy and
also on board Green’s Indiamen, before I graduated
in medicine) seeing a look in the face of a
young sailor who had fallen from the mizzen
shrouds to the deck, very like what I saw, or
fancied I saw, in Captain Denzil’s face to-day.
But that was a fall, compared with which even
the accidents of a steeplechase are trifles,’ added
the doctor more cheerfully, and with an evident
wish to change the subject.</p>

<p>‘It is a mad sport, taken as a form of excitement,’
said Sir Sykes, his resentment beginning
to turn itself towards the institution of steeplechasing;
‘worse still, when mere greed actuates
the performers, brutal curiosity the spectators.’</p>

<p>‘I quite agree with you, Sir Sykes, quite,’
chimed in the doctor, with a bird-like chirrup of
acquiescence. ‘The mob, my dear sir, whether in
decent coats or in torn fustian, is animated by
much the same spirit which caused the Roman
amphitheatre to ring with applause as wild beasts
and gladiators, pitted against one another in the
arena, stained the sand with’——</p>

<p>Here Captain Prodgers came in on tiptoe to
say that Jasper was awake and sensible; that he
had twice asked if his father had not yet arrived;
and that he, Prodgers, had volunteered to make
inquiries, and hearing the sound of voices as he
passed the half-closed door, had entered. ‘You,
Sir Sykes, I have had the pleasure of meeting once
before—at Lord Bivalve’s, in Grosvenor Place,’
he said with a bow. ‘Captain Prodgers of the
Lancers,’ he added, by way of an introduction.
The baronet returned the bow stiffly. He had
some recollection of Captain Jack’s jolly face
beaming across the Bivalve mahogany; but he felt
anything but well disposed towards the owner of
Norah Creina and the man who had led his son
into the present scrape.</p>

<p>‘A friend of my son’s, I am aware,’ said Sir
Sykes half bitterly.</p>

<p>‘And I am afraid, “Save me from my friends,”
is the saying just now uppermost in your mind,
Sir Sykes,’ returned Captain Prodgers. ‘But I
do assure you that, hard hit in the pocket as I
have been in this precious business, I’d sooner
have lost the double of my bets, than have seen
that poor fellow knocked about as he has been.
I’m no chicken, and sentiment don’t come natural
to me, but I give you my word that had the
tumble turned out as bad as I feared it would
when first I saw it, I should—never have forgiven,
myself, that’s all.’ Having said which, Jack
Prodgers mentioned to the doctor that he should
be found when required in the coffee-room, and
with another bow to Sir Sykes, withdrew. The
baronet, guided by Dr Aulfus, entered the darkened
room where Jasper lay.</p>

<p>‘Is that you, sir? I thought you would come,’
said the hurt man from the bed, stretching out
his feeble hand, and as Sir Sykes took the thin
fingers within his own grasp, his anger, smouldering
yet, seemed for the moment to die away,
chased by the crowd of early recollections that
beset his memory. He could remember Jasper as
a lisping child, a quick intelligent boy, unduly
indulged and pampered it is true, but bold-faced
and free-spoken at an age when many a youngster,
far nobler in every quality of heart and head, is
sheepish and tongue-tied. In those days father
and mother had been proud and fond of the boy,
and Jasper’s future prosperity had been no unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>{134}</span>
element in Sir Sykes’s schemes and day-dreams.</p>

<p>‘You do not feel much pain now?’ asked the
baronet gently.</p>

<p>‘In my arm and head I do,’ said the patient,
stirring uneasily.</p>

<p>The doctor, as he adjusted the pillows, smiled
hopefully. ‘A very good sign that,’ he whispered
to Sir Sykes; ‘better than I had hoped for, after
the draught. I think we may pronounce all
immediate cause for anxiety to be over.’</p>

<p>‘When can he be moved?’ asked Sir Sykes, in
the same cautious tone.</p>

<p>‘To Carbery? I should say, if he goes on as
well as he is doing now, to-morrow,’ replied Dr
Aulfus. ‘I will write down some instructions,
with which it will be well to comply, for it will be
some few days at least before he can resume his
former habits of life.’</p>

<p>‘What are you two conspiring about?’ demanded
Jasper, with an invalid’s customary peevishness,
from the bed. And then Sir Sykes had to resume
his seat and to say a few soothing words.</p>

<p>‘You’ll soon be well, my boy,’ he said kindly;
‘and sooner back with us at Carbery, under your
sisters’ good nursing. Dr Aulfus here will, I hope,
contrive to come over and give us a call every day
till you get your strength again.’</p>

<p>Dr Aulfus said that he should be delighted to
attend his patient at Carbery Chase, and indeed he
looked radiant as he said it. A physician is, after
all, a man, and probably a parent, and little Dr
Aulfus had a wife and was the happy donor of six
hostages to fortune. He valued the privilege of
professional admittance at Carbery very highly,
less on account of the emoluments directly derived
therefrom, than of the many small people who
would augur well of his skill, since beneath a
baronet’s roof he should prescribe for a baronet’s
heir.</p>

<p>The brief conversation between Sir Sykes and
his son was rendered the less marked because of
Jasper’s habitual reticence, and of his father’s
unwillingness to touch on any topic that might
prove painful. Thus the lawyer and his bills met
with no mention, and the steeplechase would also
have been passed over, had not Jasper himself
said: ‘I told Jack Prodgers I shouldn’t go in for
cross-country work again, except with the hounds
in winter. No fear, sir, of my donning the silk
jacket any more, after this sharp lesson of aching
bones and empty pockets. Don’t be angry, please,
though, with poor old Jack. He meant all for the
best, he did.’</p>

<p>Sir Sykes replied that he had already had the
pleasure of shaking hands with Captain Prodgers,
whom he had formerly met, it appeared, in London
society. And soon afterwards, in compliance with
an almost imperceptible motion of the doctor’s
head, he withdrew; and Captain Jack was recalled
to keep watch, uncomplainingly, beside his friend’s
couch, while the patient dozed or talked in
snatches.</p>

<p>‘Smoke away, old man; it rather does me good
than not,’ Jasper had said, and the captain’s cigar
was seldom extinguished during his vigil.</p>

<p>‘He’ll do!’ was the little doctor’s cheery
whisper as he paid his early morning visit to his
charge. And soon after noon, Jasper, pale and
tottering, and with his bruised arm in a sling, was
helped into one of the Carbery carriages and
propped with cushions; and under the tender
escort of his two sisters, Lucy and Blanche Denzil,
was slowly and heedfully conveyed home to Carbery
Chase.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the department of fishing-industries the march
of scientific inquiry has already borne good
fruit. The influence of the weather, or more
properly speaking of the variations of temperature,
on the plentifulness or scarcity of our food-fishes,
has grown in importance as an element in determining
the success or failure of the herring-fishery,
for example; and at more than one fishing-station
thermometrical observations are daily made by
the fishermen, and reported to the meteorological
authorities, who in their turn deduce generalisations
and laws from the observations thus recorded.
Thus the teachings of the formerly despised
‘science’ are beginning to bear fruit, and to be
openly and fully recognised; and in the future,
the fisherman, as a result of the generalisations just
alluded to, may be able to determine with tolerable
accuracy, before setting sail for the fishing-grounds,
the chances of a successful or unsuccessful day’s
labour. Add to this, that, with increased knowledge
of the conditions of life, development, and
general history of our food-fishes, wise legislation
may provide for the protection of these fishes and
for the determination of the proper periods for
the exercise of the fisher’s art, and it will be
owned that the gains from a scientific investigation
of the fishing-industries are simply incalculable.</p>

<p>For these reasons we have peculiar pleasure
in noting the appearance of a small volume,
under the title of <i>Sea Fisheries</i>, by E. W. H.
Holdsworth, and <i>Salmon Fisheries</i>, by Archibald
Young, Commissioner of Scotch Salmon Fisheries
(London: E. Stanford. 1877). The work
is produced under the joint authorship of two
gentlemen long connected with this important
branch of British industry. To Mr E. W. H.
Holdsworth has been allotted the task of giving
an account of the sea fisheries of Britain; whilst
Mr Archibald Young, one of the Commissioners
of Scotch Salmon Fisheries, has undertaken the
task of giving an account of the interests connected
with the capture of the king of fishes. Mr
Holdsworth has to do with the salt water, Mr
Young chiefly with the fresh.</p>

<p>Within the last sixty or seventy years, the
herring fisheries of Scotland, chiefly prosecuted
on the north-east coast, have risen to be a most
important national industry and source of wealth,
the value of the catch in a good year amounting
to between two and three millions sterling. Needing
no cultivation, the sea yields an annual harvest
almost incredible in amount. Of course much
capital is embarked; but without the hardihood,
the enterprise, and the daring risks encountered by
the fishermen, all would be unavailing. It is seen
by a late Report, that in the united fisheries of
herrings, cod, and ling, in 1876, nearly fifteen
thousand boats, decked and undecked, were engaged,
the total value of which amounted to
upwards of a million sterling. Ever on the outlook
for what will advance the interests of the
herring fishery, the capitalists engaged in the
business have latterly added a fast-sailing steamer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>{135}</span>
to the fleets of boats; by which means herrings
caught at a considerable distance are transferred
from the boats to the steamer, rapidly brought
into port, and being there properly prepared, are
despatched by railway to various parts of the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Railways, by facilitating transit, have been
immensely advantageous to all kinds of fisheries.
It might now be said that by this ready means
of transit the most inland towns in the country
are now as well supplied with fresh fish as towns
on the coast; in many cases better. Ice has also
played an important part in the transmission of
fish to distant places. Salmon being thus preserved
till it reaches the market, arrives in the
best condition, and is sent to table fresh as when
caught. One has only to look at the quantities
of beautiful salmon and other fish spread out on
marble benches of the fishmongers in any of our
larger towns, to see what railways and ice have
done for this branch of industry.</p>

<p>Mr Holdsworth expresses strong regret that the
prospects of the Irish fisheries are not by any
means of a promising kind, as far as the cultivation
of the art or industry is concerned. All authorities
agree in regarding the coasts of Ireland in most
instances as representing fishing-grounds in which
stores of wealth lie unheeded and uncared for. This
is a state of matters much to be deplored, for the
sake of all parties concerned—fishermen, consumers,
and the nation at large. Some years ago, when
we were in Ireland, we heard it mentioned that
much of the fish sold in Dublin was supplied by
fishermen from the coast of Wales; and we likewise
heard that large quantities of dried white-fish
were introduced to Portrush by fishermen
from Islay and other western isles of Scotland.
Though it is stated that the famine of thirty years
ago has had much to do with the depressed state
of the Irish fisheries, and that emigration has also
affected them, we yet fail to see why, by a little
enterprise, the still resident natives should not be
able to beat both the Welsh and Scotch out of
their own market.</p>

<p>As regards the salmon fisheries, Mr Young
leads us into a region which is still in some
particulars a field of debate and controversy.
There are very few readers, it may be presumed,
who are ignorant of the controversies, for instance,
which have been carried on concerning the correct
answer to the question, ‘Are parr the young
of salmon?’—a query which Mr Young, along
with the great majority of naturalists, answers
unhesitatingly in the affirmative. The natural
history of the salmon forms the starting-point of
all knowledge of the fish, and of the information
necessary for determining the conditions under
which it may be properly and successfully caught—the
terms ‘properly’ and ‘successfully’ in this case
being taken as including the best interests of the
fish and its race, as well as the interests of its
human captors. Briefly detailed, the life-history of a
salmon may be said to begin with the ascent of the
parent-fishes in autumn and early winter to the
upper reaches of our rivers for the purpose of depositing
their eggs. In each salmon-mother it has
been calculated about nine hundred eggs exist for
every pound of her weight, and these eggs she deposits
in a trench, excavated by aid of the jaw, in the
gravelly bed of the stream. Fertilised after being
deposited, by the milt of the male parent, the
latter covers the eggs with gravel by means of his
fins—the tail-fin being, as far as can be ascertained,
the chief agent and means in effecting this necessary
action. Such eggs as escape the attack of
enemies—and of these, in the shape of aquatic
birds and of other fishes, the salmon-ova have
more than enough—undergo development, and are
hatched in from ninety to one hundred and thirty
days.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting study were we to
trace the stages through which the young fish
becomes evolved from its simple germ, and the
wondrous formation of tissues and organs out of
the soft jelly-like matter of which the egg is
primarily composed. But want of space forbids;
and our readers must therefore fancy for themselves
the process whereby the hidden artist Nature
works through development, and at length shapes
out the young salmon, or ‘parr.’ It may be
mentioned in proof of the small proportion
borne by the salmon-eggs actually deposited, to
those developed, that authorities agree in stating
that out of three thousand eggs deposited, scarcely
<i>one</i> egg may survive—so terrible is the destruction
of young salmon. This fact alone, as Mr Young
argues, should tell powerfully as an argument in
favour of <i>artificial</i> propagation; since out of three
thousand eggs which are thus hatched, at least one
thousand young fishes may be successfully reared.</p>

<p>The curious fact is noticed that in most if not
all broods of salmon, half of the parrs will become
‘smolts’—as they are called in their next stage—at
the end of a year or so, whilst the other half
will not become smolts <i>until after the lapse of two
years and more</i>. This incongruity, if we may so
term it, has led to the questions, ‘Do the parrs
become smolts between thirteen and fifteen months
after they have left the egg, or at the age of two
years and two months?’ Both questions may
apparently be answered in the affirmative, since
each brood exhibits this peculiar feature of some
of its members coming to the smolt-stage long
before the others. Mr Young remarks on the
authority of a salmon-breeder in the north, that
about eight per cent. of the salmon hatched by this
gentleman became smolts at the end of the first
year; about sixty per cent. at the end of the
second year; and about thirty-two per cent. at the
end of the third year. These facts would seem
to indicate that the end of the second year is the
most natural period for the assumption of the
smolt-guise, which, as distinguished from that of
the parr, exhibits a beautiful coat of silvery mail.</p>

<p>The parr, it may be remarked, dies if placed in
sea-water, whereas the smolt thrives in the latter
element. On reaching the sea, the young smolt
may measure from four to five inches. After a
residence in the sea of some six or eight weeks,
the smolt returns to its river as a ‘grilse,’ which
varies from five to eight or nine pounds in weight,
according to the time it has remained in the sea.
After returning to its river the grilse spawns, and
then returns to the sea. The features of the
mature salmon are now apparent, and the fish
increases in size after each such annual migration
to the sea. Indeed nothing is more extraordinary
in the history of the salmon than its rapid increase
and growth after these periodical migrations to
salt water. Three salmon which weighed ten,
eleven and a half, and twelve and a half pounds as
they were migrating seawards, were duly marked;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>{136}</span>
and on being caught six months afterwards when
returning to the fresh water, were found to have
increased in weight to the extent of seventeen,
eighteen, and nineteen pounds respectively. Although
salmon usually return to the rivers in
which they first saw the light, yet it has been
ascertained that the practice is not an invariable
one. There is no good reason why one river
should not suit a salmon as well as another, and
in their wide migrations these fishes are exceedingly
likely to enter rivers other than their native
streams.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting topics touched upon
by Mr Young in his observations, is that regarding
the relative late or early development of salmon
in different Scotch rivers. Prefacing, that a
‘clean’ salmon is a fish that has been for some
time in the sea, it has been generally believed
that rivers which issue from a lake are ‘early’
rivers—or in other words that they are streams
which clean salmon will ascend in the early
spring. But this idea receives little or no support
from facts as they stand. Many early
Scotch rivers have no lake heads; whilst many
Scotch rivers which run out of or through lakes
are late rivers. Mr Frank Buckland thinks a
river’s ‘earliness’ in the matter of salmon depends
on its proportion of mileage in length to its square
mileage of ‘catchment’—that is of the land-area
from which the river is fed. This, however, seems
to us a whimsical theory, and might be disproved
by facts. As regards the ‘earliness’ of rivers, Mr
Young’s theory is that much depends on temperature;
in fact, temperature is known to be the
chief cause which regulates the distribution of
life in the sea, and there is no one fact, so far as
we are aware, which can be said to militate
against his views. His theory is, however, being
tested by the Scottish Meteorological Society at
Inverugie; by the Duke of Richmond, on the
Spey; by the Duke of Sutherland, on two early
and two late rivers in Sutherlandshire; and by
the Tweed Commissioners—the method of testing
being by thermometers applied to the fresh water
of the rivers, and to the sea near their mouths.</p>

<p>The latter part of the volume under notice is
occupied with statements relative to salmon fishery
laws and legislation, a subject in which the author
is naturally deeply interested, and in which our
knowledge of the salmon naturally culminates
when the fish is regarded from an economic
standpoint. In Scotland, it seems we are far behind
England and Ireland in respect that there
are no Inspectors of salmon fisheries empowered
to make annual inspections and reports on the
Scotch salmon fisheries! And this fact becomes
the more inexplicable, and the more urgently
demands remedy, when we consider that the
Scotch fisheries are many times as valuable as
those of our English neighbours. Then also, Mr
Young has a most justifiable grumble at the fact
that, in our statutes, there are very inadequate
provisions made for the removal of artificial and
natural obstructions in salmon rivers, and for
the prevention of pollutions; and no close-time
for trout or char. The importance of clearing
away natural obstructions to the ascent of the
salmon in rivers is well exemplified when it is
found that in Scotland no less than 478 miles of
river and loch are thus closed against these fishes.
No less forcibly shewn is the vexatious fact that
rivers are polluted and rendered unfitted for
breeding-streams by means and methods which the
River Pollution Commissioners in their Reports
declare to be preventable at a moderate cost, without
injury to the manufactures with which they
are connected.</p>

<p>Besides pollution, two things are especially detrimental
to the Scottish salmon fisheries. The
first to be mentioned, is the abominable practice
of building weirs across rivers in order to send
water into mill-lades, and the ignoring of the law
that requires that the water shall be periodically
diverted into the river again. Certain proprietors,
to make the most of their lands, give perpetual
leases of ground to manufacturers of one kind or
other, with liberty to build a weir and take water
to turn their machinery. There may be provisions
in the lease as there is in law to the effect that
the withdrawal of water shall cease during the
night and on Sundays. Such provisions are,
however, in many instances neglected, as giving
too much trouble. The result is, that the whole
river, or very nearly the whole, except in times of
flood, is diverted into the mill-lade, whereby trout
and salmon are unable to surmount the weir, and
are effectually barred from getting to the upper
part of the stream. In plain terms, by the selfishness
of a proprietor (or a pair of them, one on
each side), all who dwell on the river above the
weir are deprived of the fish which nature had
bountifully assigned to them. Already in these
pages we have alluded to a scandalous case of this
kind on the Tweed.</p>

<p>The second of the two things which act detrimentally
on the Scottish salmon fisheries is the circumstance
that certain landed proprietors near the
mouths of some rivers possess a right to establish
nets for the purpose of catching all the salmon
that attempt to go up the stream. We do not contest
the legality of their arrangements. We only
speak of the cruel way it acts on the rights of all
who live in the upper parts of the river, and on
whose waters the salmon have bred. While the
lower proprietors catch the great bulk of the fish,
those higher up get but a miserable remnant.
During the whole of the time that the nets are on,
the lower proprietors have a practical monopoly of
the fishings. Is that at all reasonable? As a consequence,
first of the weirs, and second of the netting
system of the lower proprietors, there is evoked
throughout the upper part of rivers in Scotland, a
gloomy and almost vengeful hatred of the existing
salmon-fishing system. Of course the higher and
middle classes take no part in demonstrating their
sense of the injustice that is committed. The
lower classes, less scrupulous, and indignant at the
rapacity of the weir-owners and lower proprietors,
take such salmon as they can get hold of in spawning-time,
thus destroying by myriads in embryo
what should have been a vast national advantage.
Detesting as we do all sorts of poaching and
irregularities, we are glad that the Commissioners
appointed to investigate the condition of the
Scottish salmon fisheries, have laid stress upon
the miserable imperfections to which we have
ventured to draw attention.</p>

<p>Mr Young informs us that in 1874, as many
as 32,180 boxes of Scotch salmon were sent to the
London market alone, the estimated value of which
might possibly be L.321,800. It seems to us, however,
a hard case that the great bulk of such valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>{137}</span>
property should be secured by proprietors at or
near the mouths of the several rivers, to the exclusion
of those in the upper reaches of the streams,
who ought to have an equal right to participate
in the annual fish-harvest. Free-trade in salmon-fishing,
so much as lies within the limits of strict
justice, is still in expectation. We commend the
subject to the further consideration of Frank
Buckland, Mr Young, and brother-anglers.</p>

<p class="ph3">A SOUTH-AUSTRALIAN STORY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the end of November, about two years
ago, I received the following curt note from my
brother Donald, who like myself is a sheep-farmer
in South Australia. ‘<span class="smcap">My dear Jerry</span>,
Lizzie sends her love, and hopes to see you when
your shearing is over, as usual. If you’ll say
what day, I’ll fetch you from Ballarat.—Yours
affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Don Gardiner</span>.’
</p>

<p>‘<i>N.B.</i>—Just begun to wash the wool. Lizzie’s
sister says she has seen my apparatus at Conolly’s,
but I don’t think it. Ask Conolly.’</p>

<p>Conolly was a neighbour of mine, and he
chanced to have brought me Don’s letter, and to
be lighting his pipe at my elbow while I read it.</p>

<p>‘Conolly,’ said I, ‘do you know any of Mrs
Gardiner’s sisters? She has an unlimited number,
I believe, for I have met a fresh one—sometimes
two fresh ones—every Christmas for about half-a-dozen
years, and here is still another I never
heard of. She appears to be acquainted with you
and this neighbourhood’——</p>

<p>‘O yes; that’s Cinderella,’ interrupted Conolly,
as he abstracted a bundle of newspapers from our
joint post-bag and began to rip the wrapping
from them. ‘Haven’t you seen Cinderella? She
was never out of Tasmania, I suppose, until last
spring, when she was staying up here with
the Macdonalds. The Macdonald girls called
her Cinderella because she had always been the
one to stay at home and keep house while the
others went about. Her proper name is Rachel.
O Jerry, Jerry!’ he broke out suddenly, laughing
in what seemed to me a very offensive manner
(my proper name I may mention being Gerald),
‘your sister-in-law Lizzie will be too many for
you. She won’t let you escape this time. She
has kept Rachel as her last card.’</p>

<p>‘If ever I marry a woman with such a name
as that, I hope I shall be a henpecked husband
for the rest of my life!’ I retorted angrily, seizing
a paper-knife and beginning to tear away at the
<i>Australasian</i>, so as to drown further conversation
upon what was a very sore subject.</p>

<p>My brother Donald’s wife Lizzie was as good
and kind a little woman as ever breathed, but like
many young wives in happy circumstances, she
was a matchmaker. And being impulsive, effusive,
and not quite—what shall I call it? I don’t like
to say she was not quite a lady, but that would
suggest my meaning—she did not pursue her
calling with that tact and judgment which its
delicate nature required. I need not say more,
except that she had a number of spinster sisters,
and one only bachelor relative, who lived all by
himself in single-blessedness on his own fine and
thriving property, and that I was that male victim.
I beg pardon of all the Misses Lindsay for using
such a term; I was not a victim as far as <i>they</i>
were concerned. But I did feel it hard that I
should be laughed at wherever I went as the
captive knight of half-a-dozen fair ones, when I
had never had the choosing of one of them.</p>

<p>When I received the above letter I had just
seen my last wool-bale packed on the last bullock-dray
and started on its slow journey to Melbourne;
and the day after I set off myself on
my yearly visit to Don. He was less fortunate
in respect of sheep-shearing than I, for living in
an exceptionally cool district, where an exceptionally
wet and wintry spring had kept everything
behindhand, he had still all his troubles to come.
I thought of that as I buttoned myself into my
Ulster, which I was glad of that cold morning,
though Christmas was only a month off; and I
reflected that I should be the only unemployed
man at the disposal of the household until the
shearing was over, and foresaw (as I thought) the
consequences. I made up my mind, however,
that I would defy Lizzie’s machinations in a more
systematic manner than heretofore. May I be forgiven
for so priggish a determination.</p>

<p>It was midnight before I reached Ballarat, where
Don usually met me; but upon this occasion I
found a telegram stating that he was too busy to
leave his farm, and would send for me next day.
So I had one game of pool at the club and went to
bed; and next morning enjoyed an hour or two
over newly arrived English papers and periodicals,
and a solitary lunch; and then the familiar old
ramshackle buggy and the beautiful horses Don
was famed for made their appearance, and I
set off on the last stage of my journey. When
I arrived at my destination it was dark and
raining heavily; and the groom who opened the
stable-gate told me that my brother had not long
come up from the wash-place and was interviewing
shearers at the hut. I was wet and muddy,
so I went straight to my room without even
asking for my sister-in-law, who was usually in
her nursery at that hour, and proceeded to make
myself respectable for dinner. Presently I heard
Don about the passages (the house was ‘weather-board’
and the partitions extremely thin) asking
the servants where I was; and then his head and
a half-bared neck appeared in the narrow aperture
between my door and the door-post.</p>

<p>‘Glad to see you, old boy; but I’m too dirty
to come in,’ said he. ‘Seen Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet.’</p>

<p>‘Seen Rachel?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet. But I say, old man, would you mind
telling me how many <i>more</i> sisters you’ve got?’</p>

<p>‘No more,’ said Don with a grin. ‘She’s the
last one, and she’s the best of them all.’</p>

<p>‘Then I hope I may be allowed for once to
enjoy the society of one of Lizzie’s sisters, in a
friendly way,’ I grumblingly responded (for I may
as well admit that Don and I had had confidences
of old on this subject). ‘Don’t you think you
could give Lizzie a notion that I don’t mean to
get married, or that I’ve a sweetheart up the
country, or something of that sort?’</p>

<p>‘Not I,’ rejoined my brother, laughing. ‘I’m
not going to spoil her fun, poor little soul; you’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>{138}</span>
old enough to take care of yourself.’ And with
that he went off, whistling cheerfully, to his
dressing-room.</p>

<p>When I had completed my toilet, I gathered up
some boxes of choice cigars that I had been purchasing
in town, and carried them to the door
of the adjoining apartment, which had been Don’s
smoking-room ever since I had known it. To
my surprise, the bolt shot sharply as I touched the
handle, and I heard a rustle of drapery inside.
A housemaid coming along with lamps for the
dinner-table called out hastily: ‘O sir, that is Miss
Rachel’s room now. The smoking-room is at the
end of the verandah, where Miss Carry slept last
year. Mrs Gardiner wished it to be changed
because she didn’t like the smell of tobacco so
near the bedrooms.’</p>

<p>I took back my boxes, thinking no more about
it, and went on to the drawing-room, which was
full of light and warmth and comfort, as usual,
and where I found two of my little nieces sitting
demurely on a sofa in their best frocks, ready to
rush into my arms. Lizzie came hurrying in
after me, rosy and radiant, and with plenty of
flounces and colours about her, and gave me her
own enthusiastic welcome; and then Don, spruce
and perfumed, joined us. Don in his early years
had been a dandy, and a little youthful weakness
remained in him still. He never came to dinner
without rings on his fingers and subtle odours in
his clothes; and he was at great pains to keep a
pair of Dundreary whiskers accurately adjusted on
each side of a closely shaven chin. He had been
ten years in the Bush, and had never objected
to ‘roughing it’ in a general way; but he persisted
in shaving himself every morning, let what
would, happen; which singular habit in an Australian
country gentleman very much puzzled his
bearded friends. I for one, used to quiz him
as well as I knew how, when I saw him swathe
his neck in a handkerchief, before going out to his
work, if the sun shone too strongly; but I respect
his little vanities nowadays, and hope he will keep
his white throat and his Dundreary whiskers as
long as he lives, bless him. He took one of his
little girls on his knee, and questioned me about
my station matters and about Conolly’s sheep-wash
(which was <i>not</i> so well furnished with improvements
as his own, much to his satisfaction);
and Lizzie gave me an account of the development
of her respective children since I had seen them
last, including the cutting of the baby’s teeth;
and then the dinner-bell rang.</p>

<p>‘Where’s Rachel?’ inquired Don.</p>

<p>I turned a languid eye upon the door when we
heard the sound of a distant rustle, expecting to
see one of the smart and smiling damsels I was so
used to, and wondering whether this one would
be dark or fair. With a slow and quiet step she
came along the hall and entered the room, and
my heart began suddenly to beat in a very unpleasant
manner. She had a delicate, thoughtful,
but piquant face, wavy brown hair modestly
and becomingly set, and a slight figure daintily
dressed in pale blue silk, with a little white lace
about throat and arms; and yet she was the image
of Marie Antoinette in Delaroche’s picture, only
with a more majestic dignity of carriage, if that
could be, and a more cold and calm disdain upon
her face. As soon as I saw her, and felt the exceedingly
faint acknowledgment she vouchsafed
when we were formally introduced, I intuitively
guessed—with a horrible sense of shame and mortification—that
she had overheard what I said to
Don in my bedroom through those card-paper
walls!</p>

<p>I never thought I should feel so concerned at
standing ill with one of Lizzie’s sisters as I felt
before that evening came to an end. All through
dinner I saw, without looking, offended dignity in
the poise of her head and the studied repose of
her manner, and heard the ring of it in every
inflection of her voice, though it was so subtle and
delicate that only a guilty conscience could detect
it. It was a great deal worse in the evening, when
Lizzie began her fussy little contrivances for
throwing us together. The poor little woman
never had so impracticable and aggravating a sister
to manage; and I never met one who attempted
to treat me with such open indifference and thinly-veiled
contempt. It is unnecessary for me to state
the consequences. I began to interest myself in
this Miss Lindsay as I had never interested myself
in the others. I began to hanker for her good
opinion, as I had never hankered for theirs. I
longed to set myself straight with her, and beg her
forgiveness for a thoughtless insult that I would
have given worlds to recall, and to feel that the
way was open between us to meet and associate as
friends. This longing grew apace as the evening
wore on, but the prospect of its gratification grew
less and less. Until the little ones were taken
away by their nurse she devoted herself to them,
telling them stories most of the time in a dark
corner, whence merry chatter and ripples of subdued
laughter came flowing out to us; but when
they were gone, the bright vivacity that was her
true characteristic went too, and she became Marie
Antoinette again.</p>

<p>With an amiable wish to make things pleasant,
Lizzie asked her to pour out the tea; but she
merely stood in front of me at the tea-table, with
her little nose in the air, and asked me whether
I took sugar and cream, in a high clear tone
that brought a puzzled wonder into her sister’s
face and a slow smile to Don’s. I came and
stood beside her, to take the cups from her
hand (her pretty head was about level with the
flower in my button-hole), and she tried to ignore
me, but could not. Her hands shook slightly and
a little angry flush came and went in her face;
but I preferred that to having no notice at all.
Later on she went to the piano, and sung song
after song for the delectation of Lizzie and Don,
neither of whom had the hearing ear and the
understanding heart to appreciate the pure quality
and poetic sweetness of her voice. By this time I
was very low-spirited, and I drew away from my
host, who was growing sleepy after his hard day’s
work, and took a chair near her—which of course
was a signal to Lizzie to leave the room. As
she sung on, forgetful of me and of everything but
the poetry awaking in her, and as I studied the
pose of her slight figure and half-bent head, and
the now dreamy happiness in her face, and listened
for the first time after many years to the true
translation of a language that I loved, a vague perception
dawned in me that there was some latent
fellowship between us. And then I felt that
Fate had indeed been hard.</p>

<p>The silence of the room was presently brought
into strong relief by a deep snore from Don,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>{139}</span>
whereupon she suddenly rose from the piano and
saw that we were virtually alone. ‘Good-night,
Mr Gardiner,’ she said promptly, holding out a
somewhat reluctant hand and stiffening back into
her unnatural stateliness.</p>

<p>I took it and held it and looked into her face;
and I tried to tell her, as well as plain ‘good-night’
would do it, that I knew what had happened
and wanted her to forgive me. I think she
guessed what my look meant, by the sudden
crimson flame in her face; but she walked out of
the room with as much dignity as she had first
walked into it, without another word.</p>


<p class="p2">The early days of December were cold and wet,
and the shearing was a protracted and troublesome
affair. Don hovered about restlessly, whether in
or out of the house, always bothered and anxious,
and paying frequent visits to the barometer. The
ladies clung to their fireside as if they had been in
England; and I tied myself to Lizzie’s apron-string
with an abject alacrity that puzzled and charmed
her. My opportunities for ‘improving the occasion’
were many, but somehow I could never turn
them to account. The pride of that little maiden
was quite beyond my management. Lizzie threw
us together; she left us alone; she did all that in
her lay to further my desires for a reconciliation
and an understanding; but the implacable resentment
of the last of the Lindsays towards me for
that wretched slip of the tongue was a stone wall
I could not climb over. The worst of it was,
she did and said nothing tangibly offensive; and
I was precluded by all sorts of considerations from
mentioning the subject we were both (and that we
both knew we were) thinking of. So matters went
on day after day. And before a great many days
were past I was over head and ears in love—I may
as well say it and have done with it—and began
to feel desperate and dangerous. She walked
about the house with her grand air, my Queen
Marie Antoinette, my little tyrant that I could
almost have demolished with a finger and thumb;
and I, standing six feet three in my stockings, had
to acknowledge that she was invincible as well as
unmerciful. Unregenerate savage as I was, I had
faint longings now and then to take her by those
slender shoulders, and shake her.</p>

<p>There were times when she became her sweet
self, and could not help it though she tried; and
these times were born of music. She and I both
loved music with that special love that nature
permits to a few people; but to no one else in the
house did the ‘heaven-born maid’ present attractions.
Don, hard at work all day, could go to
sleep after dinner in his arm-chair; and Lizzie,
after her manner, could go out of the room in the
middle of the most charming song. Then, when
we were singing together, or when she was gentle
and gracious with the spirit of melody in her, then
was the oil thrown upon my troubled waters. At
times such as these it flashed across me that she
was aware of it.</p>

<p>At length on one of these occasions I made a
dash at her guarded citadel; I will not say in what
words, but with the blundering foolishness that
I suppose characterises all implied aspirations;
albeit with sufficient plainness to leave no chance
of being misunderstood; and then I had indeed to
bite the dust for once in my life. She had been
singing <i>Ruth</i> with the most touching pathos and
abandonment—‘Where thou goest I will go, and
there will I be buried’—and I could not stand it.
Don was in the room, but snoring in that comfortable
undertone which denoted a sound and quiet
slumber. She stood with her back to the piano,
and the sheet of music trembling and rustling in
her hands, watching his nodding head in the
distance, and turning her delicate profile to my
view.</p>

<p>‘No; I will not,’ she half whispered with
haughty rapidity. ‘You should have known I
would not. I do not particularly want to marry
anybody,’ she added, flashing round upon me with
her crimson face; ‘but I will never marry <i>you</i>.
I made up my mind to that long ago.’</p>

<p>Everybody knows how, in the supremely solemn
moments of one’s life, one is apt to be assailed with
most incongruously ludicrous ideas. In spite of
my bitter mortification at her reply, an absurd
rhyme that I had heard somewhere, flashed into
my head:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do not be like Nancy Baxter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who refused a man before he’d axed her.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I believe she saw the ghost of a smile that might
have hovered round my eyes when I begged to
know why she had made up her mind never to
marry me; and that made her savage.</p>

<p>‘Because you think I came here to be made
love to,’ she retorted, with all the concentrated
contempt that her sweet face and voice could hold.
‘You think Lizzie and I have been plotting to
catch you—you think we wanted to inveigle you
into marrying me! I know what you are going to
say’—as I rose and seized her hands, to stop her—‘but
it is not the truth. I <i>heard</i> you’—lifting her
angry eyes, now wet with unshed tears, to mine—‘I
heard you, with my own ears, tell Don to warn
Lizzie beforehand that you did not want to be
married.’</p>

<p>‘I know you did,’ I replied, tightening my
hold of her hands, while she made feeble efforts to
get away; ‘and I wish my tongue had been cut
out before I could have insulted you and her like
that. Forgive me, Rachel; I have been punished
enough.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot,’ she answered, still panting with
her excitement. ‘I should be ashamed of myself
if I could take a man who had even <i>thought</i> of me
like that.’</p>

<p>Two tears began to trickle from her eyes, and a
little hysterical catch in her breath betrayed to me
that her defiant courage was failing her. I would
not let her go. Love and shame and a resentful
disappointment made me a little savage too.</p>

<p>‘I never <i>did</i> think of you like that,’ I said
sternly; ‘and you know it. I must hold you till
I clear myself—I cannot bear it’——</p>

<p>A log tumbled in the grate, and Don woke up.
She caught away her hands and sped out of the
room; and I walked through a French window
into the cool summer night, too full of wrath and
love to speak to anybody.</p>

<p>This was how we stood when at last (on Saturday,
the 18th of December) the true Christmas
weather came, and we found ourselves in the hot
afternoon alone on the croquet-lawn—alone for the
first time since my stormy wooing was interrupted.
Don being still busy in the sheep-yards and shearing-shed,
I had been playing singly against
Lizzie and her; and now Lizzie had been called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>{140}</span>
away to the nursery to consult with a needlewoman
who was at work there. We were both
anxious (though for very different reasons) to
leave off playing when our chaperon had departed;
but it was not easy to do so in the middle of a
game, especially as she had instructed her partner
to play for both of them until she returned. So
we knocked the balls about for a few minutes in
embarrassed silence, and then had an altercation
as to which hoop Lizzie had been through; and
then we both got a little huffy, and played, first
with indifference, and then with a malicious
energy, which resulted at last in my sending her
partner’s ball into the thickest Portugal laurels in
the shrubbery.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ I exclaimed with
compunction, as she solemnly marched off to look
for it. ‘Let me find it for you.’</p>

<p>‘Do not trouble yourself,’ she replied sharply;
and immediately dashed in between the laurel
and a very prickly rose-bush, whose long sprays
caught her muslin dress and tore it. I saw her
straw-hat amongst the big dark branches, and
her little hand searching under them for a
moment or two; then she started up suddenly
with a quick cry, and bounded into the path
again.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter? Have you hurt yourself,’
I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Her hat fell to the ground, and she stood before
me with the blazing sun on her pretty head, and
a wide-eyed horror in her face. ‘Wait a minute
for me!’ she panted breathlessly; ‘I want you to
help me—I have been bitten.’ Before I could
collect my senses to understand what she meant,
she had sped like a flash of light into the house;
and dashing into the laurel bush, I saw what had
happened. A big black snake was gliding away
from the spot where she had been kneeling.</p>

<p>What was to be done? I stood still for a moment
paralysed; then I sent up a hurried prayer for
help, and simultaneously ‘cooeyed’ three or four
times with all the force of a powerful pair of
lungs, for Don at the wool-shed. Then I hurried
after her, and met her coming through the door
of my brother’s dressing-room with one of his
razors in her hand. Her face was white and set
as she seized my hand and hurried me into the
smoking-room, which was near us, and turned the
key in the lock. I knew what she wanted; and I
set my teeth in an agony that no words could
express, and which I can never think of now
without a shudder.</p>

<p>‘Look!’ she said piteously, with a little sob
in her throat; and I looked, and saw one of the
fingers of her left hand tied round tightly with a
piece of string below the first joint, and the end
of it already livid and swollen and shewing the
unmistakable punctures of the snake’s fangs. She
laid her other hand on my arm, and looked up at
me with a beseeching face that nearly unmanned
me.</p>

<p>‘Help me!’ she whispered eagerly; ‘now—now;
before the others come!’ And she held out the
razor, open and shining. ‘It is no use to suck it—it
only wastes time,’ as I seized her finger and
put it in my mouth. ‘Don’t, don’t! I want to
be on the safe side. I don’t want to die! O pray,
pray help me!’—now sobbing passionately—’or
else I must try to do it myself. I won’t cry out;
I won’t mind it. I will turn my head away.’
She laid her finger on the edge of the table, and I
took the razor from her, and with all the courage
I could muster, excised the wounded part. She
bore the cruel operation without a murmur.</p>


<p class="p2">An hour afterwards the commotion in the house
was over, but the shadow of death was on it.
Rachel was in her bed, white and faint and breathing
heavily, twitching with weak fingers at the
bedclothes, and staring with dull eyes into the
sad faces around her. I knelt in my room close
by with my head on my outspread arms, weeping
like a child as if my heart would break, and
listening to the creaking of the doctor’s boots and
the whisking of skirts and whispering of awed
voices on the other side of the thin wall. There
was nothing else that I was privileged to do, now
that I had done that dreadful thing which they
told me might be the saving of her precious life.</p>

<p>As the twilight fell, the voices in the sick-room
took a louder and more cheerful tone; and
presently one of them called softly: ‘Jerry, I want
you.’ Lizzie met me in the passage with a tremulous
tear-stained smiling face. ‘The doctor says
she will be all right now, and that she has to
thank you for it,’ she whispered. ‘Don’t stay
here any longer; go and have a cigar with Don.’</p>

<p>I seized her hand and kissed it, and looked at
her with my wet eyes full of foolish emotion, too
glad for speech; and the brightening intelligence
of her countenance was curious to note. ‘I thought
you didn’t care for each other,’ she said archly;
‘but,’ she added drily, ‘I suppose I was mistaken.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t suppose anything, Lizzie, there’s a good
girl. But let me know when I may see her,’ I
replied earnestly.</p>

<p>‘All right—I understand—I’ll let you know,’
she said, nodding her head vigorously with an air
of mystery and importance; and then I went,
not to have a cigar with Don, but to walk
about the dark garden alleys, alone with my
thoughts.</p>

<p>Our patient improved steadily all night, so
much so that the family assembled at breakfast as
usual. Then a great hunt was made for the snake
(at Lizzie’s instigation, on the children’s behalf),
which lasted a long while and was wholly unsuccessful.
Then church-time came, and the buggy
was ordered to take the servants and the little
girls to church; and the hot day wore on.
Towards evening, as I was loafing about the
garden, Lizzie came running across the croquet
lawn—where the balls and mallets were still lying
about as we had left them, though it <i>was</i> Sunday—and
told me that Rachel was up and dressed, and
that she chanced to be alone in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>I stole in to her in the twilight with my heart
beating fast; and for a few moments she did not
notice me. She was standing by the open piano,
small and white and weak, with a shawl wrapped
round her, gazing at the silent key-board, with
tears running down her face. No one could look
less like Delaroche’s Marie Antoinette than she
looked then.</p>

<p>I took three long steps and reached her side;
she gave a great start and turned round to meet me.
‘I shall not again be able to play to you for a long
while!’ she said, looking up at me for sympathy
in this new trouble with her soft wet eyes.</p>

<p>When she said that—instead of making me the
little speech I had expected, thanking me for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>{141}</span>
saving her life—I put out my arms. And though
we said no word, we forgave one another.</p>

<p>And how pleased Lizzie was when she saw the
last of the Lindsays transferred to my unworthy
self.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> irrigation of lands by water-channels connected
with rivers is accepted as an important
means of agricultural development in countries
subject to protracted droughts, where rain falls
only at distant and uncertain intervals. The irrigation
caused by the periodic overflow of the Nile
is a noted case in point. But for the annual overflow,
temporarily deluging the land for a foot or
two, Lower Egypt would be barren instead of a
scene of fertility. In a country like England,
where there is, generally speaking, too much
moisture, the chief consideration is to dry the land
sufficiently by draining, instead of flooding it with
water; the lesson being thus taught that as regards
the culture of soils every country must act according
to circumstances. In India, also in Ceylon,
there are some remarkable instances of the value
of irrigation, and in these countries much more of
the same kind requires to be done to avert the
horrors of lengthened drought and famine. On
this subject, we propose to say a few words
regarding large tracts in Southern Africa, which
are very much in the condition of those parts of
Egypt fertilised by the waters of the Nile.</p>

<p>We speak first of the river Oliphant, which falls
into the sea on the west of Cape Colony, and
which has various important affluents. The land
through which these streams flow is of a most
desolate character—broad belts of sand, interspersed
with low scrubby bush, swelling into
moderate hills, with rugged mountains for a background.
Upon the country in the lower part of the
Oliphant River rains have no appreciable effect;
but when the soil is thoroughly soaked by the overflow
of the streams, after the periodical inundations,
and then covered by the deposit brought down by
the floods from the upper districts, its fertility
is wonderful. The average yield is more than a
hundredfold. The quantity of land of this character
along the Lower Oliphant alone was estimated
by the government surveyor in 1859 as
eight thousand seven hundred acres.</p>

<p>Thus, like Egypt with its Nile inundations,
those districts of Cape Colony—otherwise almost
barren—are annually fertilised. But unlike Egypt,
the country is unprovided with any means for
utilising to the full extent the advantages thus
conferred. No appliances are prepared for the
purpose of storing the water thus brought down;
no artificial channels are cut for directing it and
spreading it over a large area; and when the short
rainy season has passed, the inhabitants are content
to sit down and wait for the next ‘periodical.’</p>

<p>A characteristic story is told by a colonist who
visited the locality some years ago: ‘I strolled
along the banks of the river, and was much struck
with the extremely fertile appearance of the soil,
and the very little which had been done for turning
it to account. It seemed as if the Creator had
done everything for the country, and man nothing.
Scarcely any rain had fallen for some time past,
and the river had not overflowed its banks for
more than a year. The stocks of grain and vegetables
were getting very low. The farmer was
complaining much about the long protracted
drought; and when he had finished, I took the
liberty of pointing out how he could, by leading
out the stream for the purposes of irrigation, or by
fixing a pump to be propelled by wind, on the
river’s bank, secure an abundant supply independent
of the weather. He seemed to listen with
some interest to the development of my plans;
and I began to hope that he had decided upon
doing something to relieve himself of the difficulty;
but eventually, after turning round and scrutinising
the whole horizon in the direction of the river’s
source, as if in search of some favourable symptom,
he yawned heavily, and merely observed in Dutch:
“Oh, it will rain some day!”’</p>

<p>Of the Zout or Holle River, the most northerly
of the tributaries of the Oliphant, Mr P. Fletcher,
the government surveyor, says: ‘By its arteries
it brings together the rich karroo soil of the
Hantam and Hardeveld and the rich sandy soil of
Bushmanland. The best crop of oats I have
seen in Africa was in the deposit of this “periodical.”
Other portions are of a very saline character.
At a rough guess, I believe that in many spots a
dam might be constructed three or four feet high,
and a couple of hundred feet long, which would
flood several hundred acres, thereby rendering
them richly arable. I have measured some of last
year’s “slick” two feet deep; this, of course, was
under the most favourable circumstances; but by
the use of dams, the deposit might be regulated,
the fresh slick might be allowed to deposit to its
full extent, so that in a few years the lands would
be out of the reach of ordinary floods, if desirable
that they should be so. By this system of irrigation,
even the most saline basin would become
available to agriculture, and about nine or ten
thousand acres on the banks of this one periodical
river might be brought under cultivation, which
would even excel the richest soil in the “Boland”
(upper country).</p>

<p>‘Several tributaries to the Zout River have
extensive karroo deposits; some of their basins
reaching to nearly one mile in breadth, and
their fall being so little, that, standing in their
delta, a person cannot sometimes judge with the
eye which direction water would flow. Their
water-course, which winds through the middle of
the deposit, is always well defined, and shews a
longitudinal section of the plain. Except in ordinary
heavy rains, those channels carry off all the
water without overflowing, while a few pounds
would leave them in a condition to produce fifty,
eighty, or even one hundred-fold. Such is the
nature of several tributaries of the Hartebeeste
River. I have not seen the latter, but have been
more than once informed that it has in some
places a deposit of five miles in breadth, that when
it does overflow, there is abundance of grass for all
the cattle that visit that quarter. If this description
of the Hartebeeste River be correct, the products
it may be able to yield either in the form
of grain or pasture for cattle would appear to most
people fabulous. We have here, and not here only,
but over an extensive portion of the whole colony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>{142}</span>
the richest soil in the world lying at present for
two-thirds of the year utterly unoccupied, waste
and worthless.’</p>

<p>The Hartebeeste is the last principal tributary,
from the south, of the Orange River, and rises in
the same chain of hills as the Tanqua, one of the
tributaries of the Oliphant—namely, the Roggeveld
Berg, receiving affluent streams from the south-east
and south-west, draining in fact nearly the
whole of the central northern part of the colony.
This district is at present almost neglected. The
chain of hills in fact, which runs from east to west
across the centre of the colony, cuts off the northern
half from the mass of the colonists, notwithstanding
the fact that here is the most fertile land in South
Africa.</p>

<p>The Zak, as the upper part of the Hartebeeste is
called, is another instance of the wonderful effects
upon the soil of periodical inundations. The following
particulars are given in Mr Noble’s book on
<i>Cape Colony</i>. In the dry season these streams
are comparatively small, and often a mere succession
of pools; but after rains they run briskly, and
where level with the banks, overflow and soak the
adjacent flats. In many places so very even is the
country that they may be said to have no defined
channel, and form extensive sheets of water a few
inches deep. The Zak River at two hundred and
fifty miles from its source thus varies in breadth
from one to four miles; and further on from
Onderste Doorns to Leeuwenkop it widens as
much as ten miles. Along its course is the most
valuable part of Great Bushmanland. Water can
be obtained in its bed even when dry, and its
valley generally affords pasture to cattle during
both the winter and summer months. After floods,
there are extensive alluvial bottoms on each side
of it, where agricultural products of every kind
might be raised. These are now commonly used
by the squatters as sowing lands, without any
labour or trouble beyond scratching in the seed.
One overflowing of the soil is sufficient to insure a
crop even although no rain should fall afterwards.
The returns are something marvellous, especially
those of wheat.</p>

<p>In 1859 the number of Europeans settled on the
irrigable portion of the Oliphant was estimated at
one hundred and twenty souls. When there was
an overflow of the river, they were active enough;
day and night they worked incessantly; the sun
and the moon alike witnessed that they did not eat
the bread of idleness. But talk to them of improvements
in the way of artificial irrigation by
dams or pumps, and they ridiculed the idea. Such
was the description given at that time; and such,
with very little alteration, is an accurate statement
of affairs now. The population of Calvinia
and Clanwilliam, the two districts drained by the
Oliphant River, was in 1875, 15,856, of whom
only 2046 were classed as ‘urban.’ These figures
of course include the natives as well as the
settlers; but they represent an enormous advance
in population since 1859. It is probable that if
measures were taken to secure the permanence of
the advantages which are now only temporarily
enjoyed, the population and wealth of the districts
would rapidly increase.</p>

<p>Of the fertility of the soil without any attempt
at cultivation, there are abundant evidences. A
sandy plain apparently as barren as the Sahara
itself is suddenly transformed into an expanse of
waving grass for hundreds of miles, so soon as the
annual rains occur. This ‘twaa-grass’ or Bushman
grass is an excellent fodder for horses and cattle,
which thrive and grow fat upon it in a few weeks:
even when dried up in the winter it is better feeding
than any available green pasture. The natives
scratch in their seeds and leave them to ripen,
which they do without the least attention, and
whether the country is visited by drought after
the summer rains or not.</p>

<p>The principal drawback to the complete cultivation
of the lands is the absence of roads or water-carriage.
The Orange River, though a magnificent
stream, and navigable in certain parts of its
course, is blocked by narrow gorges, shallows, falls,
and other impediments, and is useless as a water-way.
In time probably, it may be made available,
by means of inter-communicating canals to enable
the rapids, &amp;c. to be passed; but at present the
community must look to the extension of roads
and railways for the means of fully utilising
the produce which would be raised if a ready
market could be found. In this respect a decided
step has already been taken. A railway of ninety
miles in length has been constructed from Port
Nolloth on the north-west coast, in Namaqualand,
to the upper mining districts, its terminus being
at Ookiep. On the most difficult portion of the
route the cost has been very little more than a
thousand pounds a mile for this distance; and it
might be extended further eastward at a still less
cost, to the great advantage of the country drained
by the Hartebeeste. Another railway, or a good
system of roadways, is wanted to open up the
Oliphant water-shed; and with these means of
carrying away the produce—all that is necessary—the
immense natural resources of the district would
be fully developed. In the Fraserburgh district,
where the Upper Zak river rises, substantial
houses, springs, wells, and dams have already been
constructed, and plantations and gardens are being
extended; but then from Fraserburgh excellent
roads run east and west; and the railway to Cape
Town comes as far as Beaufort, situated sixty or
seventy miles south-east.</p>

<p>Finally, in Great Bushmanland, diamonds have
been found; but there are far greater and more
permanent sources of wealth than diamond-fields.
Sheep and oxen can be raised, and their wool and
hides turned to profitable account. Wheat, grapes,
and vegetables of all kinds will grow in abundance.
In fact, for pastoral and agricultural qualities the
country is unsurpassed. Here then is a field for
the enterprising emigrant from our own country.
Capital alone is wanting for its development; and
capital however small, judiciously expended, must
be at once remunerative. We are glad to be able
to add that an Act has been passed by the Cape
Parliament for granting facilities to landowners
for obtaining by loan or otherwise the means of
improving their lands by irrigation or other
similar permanent works.</p>

<p>Other districts prove how the colonists have
succeeded in turning what was, more really than
Great Bushmanland or the Lower Oliphant can
be said to be, a ‘howling desert’ into valuable
farms, by opening up springs, making dams, forming
irrigation channels, and planting trees where
no trees existed, and where water was only an
occasional and very ephemeral visitor. There is
no reason indeed why the ‘Nile lands of South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>{143}</span>
Africa’ should not rival in productiveness the
great ‘world’s wonder’ in the north of the continent;
after which, from natural circumstances,
they have been not inaptly named.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ALBATROSS_NOTES">ALBATROSS NOTES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> out in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, often
two thousand miles and more from the nearest
land, sails the albatross in its graceful and powerful
flight; now following in the wake of the ship,
to catch any chance morsel that may have fallen
from the cook’s waste-basket; now skimming along
the water, and occasionally snapping up some
small ocean-waif from the crest of a wave; or
with a few vigorous strokes of its broad wings,
gliding easily round and round the vessel, though
she may be going at the rate of a dozen knots an
hour.</p>

<p>No passenger to southern lands can have failed
to note the extraordinary powers of flight of this
magnificent bird, and the wonderful ease with
which it sweeps for some minutes together through
the air on expanded motionless pinions, rising
and falling slightly, and taking advantage of the
gravity of its own body and the angle at which
the wind strikes its feathered sails to prolong
the course of its flight with the least possible
effort. Seldom, except in very calm weather, may
it be seen to alight upon the water, from which
it rises with difficulty, running for some distance
along the surface. The ends of the wings clear
of the water, it turns towards the breeze, and
rises into the air in a gentle curve, in exactly the
same manner as a paper kite. That the albatross
follows a ship for many days in succession, sleeping
at night upon the water, and coming up with
her in the morning, there can be no doubt. We
have watched them for several consecutive evenings
during fine weather, in the latitude of the
trade-winds, settling down on the water at sundown,
and preening their feathers, until they
became mere specks in the field of the telescope;
but they were with us again in the morning soon
after sunrise; some strangers among them perhaps,
but several which, from some peculiarity
of marking, we knew to be our companions of the
day before. In one instance, a conspicuous mark
had been made by a pistol-bullet in the wing
of an old brown-headed and curiously pied bird,
by which he could be identified beyond doubt.
The second or third flight-feather had been shot
away, leaving a clearly defined gap in the wing as it
came between the light and the eye; and this
bird followed us for three days after having been
fired at, though we had been sailing an average
of nearly eight knots an hour. One of the most
striking examples of their endurance on the wing,
however, is the fact, which we have more than
once observed, that the same birds which had been
unweariedly following us in the day, accompanied
us throughout the whole of the succeeding night,
as could be easily verified by the light of the
moon.</p>

<p>It is a not uncommon practice with passengers
to endeavour to catch these noble birds by a
bait fastened to a hook and buoyed with corks.
That such a cruel practice should ever be tolerated,
even ‘to relieve the monotony of the voyage,’ is
to us inconceivable, and can only be accounted
for as the last resource of a brutally morbid fancy.</p>

<p>The albatross is essentially the scavenger of the
ocean, and we doubt whether it makes any attempt
to capture living fish unless when very hungry,
for we have seen flying-fish rising in quantities
while the albatrosses made no attempt to catch
them. That the nautilus is sometimes eaten is
evident, for we have taken it from the stomach;
but the chief food is dead fish and other refuse.
In the South Atlantic we passed the dead body
of a small whale, on and around which were at
least a hundred of these birds, either gorged or
gorging themselves with the blubber; and guns
discharged at them failed to induce many of
them to take wing. We had on one occasion
an opportunity of observing how rapidly these
birds collect about a carcase. Like vultures or
ravens, when an animal dies they discover it
very speedily, and flock to the scene of the
banquet. On a hot still evening in the South
Atlantic a horse died, and when cast overboard
next morning, the gases already formed by decomposition
enabled it to float. The few albatrosses
in our company immediately settled down upon it;
but in less than an hour we could see through the
telescope a great cloud of the birds on the sea and
hovering round the unexpected prize, the almost
entire absence of wind having kept us within two
or three miles of the spot. It may be that the
(usually) white plumage enables stragglers, far out
of human ken, to see their fellows gathering in
the neighbourhood of food; others again from still
more remote distances may see them, and so on;
until stragglers over hundreds of miles of space
may be gathered to one common rendezvous.</p>

<p>The greater part of the year is passed by them
at a distance from land; but they flock to barren
and almost inaccessible rocks to breed. There the
female lays her one dirty-white egg in a slight
depression upon the bare earth, the sitters being
frequently so close together that it is difficult
to walk without touching them. They
are totally indifferent to the presence of man,
and merely indicate their resent of his intrusion
into their nursery by snapping at him as he passes.
The parents share the labour of incubation and
rearing the young, and when this is over, they
all go seawards together, and silence and solitude
once more reign where all had lately been clamorous
and busy life.</p>

<p>The range of the albatross is very considerable,
and it may be met with to the extreme limits
of the temperate zones of both hemispheres, in
the South Atlantic and North and South Pacific
Oceans, both at sea and near headlands and isolated
rocks. During the months of May and June
in the northern, and the months of November and
December in the southern hemisphere these rocks
are tenanted by countless numbers of albatrosses
and their smaller brown relations, known to sailors
under the name of ‘Mollymawks.’ No one who
has visited an albatross nursery will readily
forget the scene. Placidly sitting upon the one
precious egg is the parent, male or female as the
case may be; and as far as the eye can reach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>{144}</span>
over the surface, the rock is crowded with the
sitters, indifferent to the presence of the human
visitor. They know nothing of man’s destructive
nature, and they fear him not. Many of them
have never seen that curious biped before, and
those which have chanced to see him on his
ships and to have suffered from his guns, are
more likely to have then regarded him as a part
of the white-sailed monster which traversed their
ocean domain, than a separate creature; and fail
to recognise him as he ‘molests their ancient
solitary reign.’</p>

<p>While viewing the interminable white forms
thus crouching upon the earth, above wheel
in graceful circles hundreds of their mates,
sending congratulations in a hoarse piping voice
to those beneath on the progress of the all-important
business of rearing the family. Here
and there sit callow uncouth nestlings; and from
seawards come the parents to discharge the contents
of their maws into the insatiable stomachs
of the expectant young. Now and again one of
the ‘bread-winners’ of the family swoops past the
observer on its twelve feet of outspread wings,
so near that he feels the shock of the divided
air, and can realise the immense strength of the
muscles which propel the creature, who, however,
is a coward in spite of his size; for the skua gull,
a bird many times smaller than himself, will
often attack him and compel him to disgorge
the product of his last foraging expedition.</p>

<p>As soon as the albatross has reared its young, a
penguin frequently takes possession of the deserted
nest, and in the very cradle of a bird destined
to traverse the ocean on unwearied wings lies a
nestling whose wings will never develop into
anything more than a pair of paddles! Great
numbers of albatrosses are caught by the natives
of the North Pacific coasts, who use the inflated
intestines as floats for their fishing-nets, and barter
the hollow wing-bones with traders for the European
markets—these bones being familiar to us
as pipe-stems. The large webbed feet when inflated
make good tobacco-pouches. We have also
seen the quills of the flight-feathers converted
into floats for roach-fishing; and many a Thames
angler patiently watches from his chair in the punt
a feather which has probably helped to carry its
former owner over the length and breadth of the
Pacific.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_NOVEL_LIFE-BOAT">A NOVEL LIFE-BOAT.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mr J. Manes of Fourth Avenue, Newhaven,
Connecticut, has invented a new kind of life-boat
which seems to possess features worthy of notice.
‘His boat consists of a hollow globe of metal or
wood, ballasted at the bottom, so that it will
always right itself immediately on touching the
water, and can never capsize even in the roughest
sea. It has compartments for water, medical
stores and provisions, bull’s-eyes to let in the
light, a door for ingress and egress, a porthole
for hoisting signals to the mast, comfortable seats
all around the inside for the passengers, and a
double hollow mast for supplying fresh air, and
for carrying off that which has become vitiated.
On the outside of the Globe boat runs a gallery,
for the use of sailors in rowing, hoisting sail, discharging
rockets, or steering. Of course the cases
would be very rare when rowing, sailing, or steering
would be required, but in case of need, all
three could be easily managed.’</p>

<p>In such a boat—which is like a large buoy fitted
with a mast—the passengers would be protected
from rain and wind, and consequently to a great
extent from cold. This seems to us to be a very
important point, as many a shipwrecked person
escapes drowning only to perish from exposure to
the weather. Mr Manes suggests that a propeller
might be attached to the boat to be worked by
a crank turned by the passengers on the inside.
It is calculated that a boat twelve feet in diameter
would carry about fifty passengers, and that it
could be carried on deck or hung over the stern
on davits, in either of which positions it might be
used as a cabin during the voyage; and further,
if hung on a universal point like a compass, it
would retain its equilibrium no matter what the
motion of the ship might be, thus affording a safe
retreat for persons subject to sea-sickness.</p>

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
